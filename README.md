NewSpeak
=============
NewSpeak is a web browser extension that raises awareness of modern usage of NewSpeak.

By default, this extension will reveal newspeak. For example:

Suppose you have the following phrase:
The Queen of Hearts used enhanced interrogation on the White Rabbit.

NewSpeak will render it as:
The Queen of Hearts used <strike>torture</strike> <i>enhanced interrogation</i> on the White Rabbit.

Optionally, NewSpeak can restore the old language. In this case, NewSpeak will render it as:
The Queen of Hearts used <strike>enhanced interrogation</strike> <i>torture</i> on the White Rabbit.
